# 🚀 My AI Journey (Day 1 - 365)

Hi, I’m Dileep.  
I’ve started a 1-year journey to become the **world’s best AI developer** — without a degree, from scratch.

This repository will track:
- 🔧 Daily learning logs
- 📚 Projects and experiments
- 🧠 Certifications, hackathons, and open source
- 🧱 Code samples & AI models

### Why I’m doing this
To build the world’s biggest AI company, and to show that self-made developers can change the world.
